[Jamie Hyneman][1] of [MythBusters][2] fame did a walk-through of his personal "don't touch" tool kit as "bonus" web content in 2008.
The original video, now gone, was extracted from the [Internet Archive][3] and [posted to YouTube about a year ago][4].
I heard about this this via [Cool Tools][5] a blog which I find endlessly helpful[^1].

The video is 20 minutes long so I took some notes:

- The toolbox itself is from "someplace in New York"
- Everything is in a precise order so he knows exactly where things are
- Many of his tools are marked with yellow spray paint
- First leaf
  - No 1 & No 2 Phillips head screwdriver
  - Regular & small flat head screwdriver
  - Several different sizes of unibits
  - Telescoping inspection mirror
  - Assorted sizes of vice grips
  - Small channel locks (looks like a [Knipex Cobra][6])
  - Dial caliper
  - Matte knife (with razor blade as a cutting surface)
  - Snap ring pliers
  - Scissors (almost looks like kitchen shears)
  - Fish hook remover (looks like [this one from Berkley][7] to grab things with
  - Cold punches of different sizes
  - Spring loaded center punch
  - Telescoping pick-up magnet
  - Glass cutter
  - Forceps
  - Offset tweezers
  - Spring-loaded tweezers that close when the pressure is released
  - Wire looping pliers with stepped jaw (similar to [this one from Gesswein][8])
  - Folding hack saw that uses reciprocating saw blades (similar to this [folding jab saw by Milwaukee][9] but with _two_ folding blades)
- Second leaf
  - Straight-cut tin snips
  - Knipex diagonal cutters (looks like a ["74 01 200 High Leverage Diagonal Cutters"][10] the brand is important because the steel is extremely hard and can be used to cut almost anything)
  - Pencils
  - Sharpie
  - [DeWalt magnetic drive guide][11] (looks like the 6" one)
  - Cold chisel
  - Crimping pliers (I couldn't find one similar to his)
  - X-Acto knife
  - Multi-bit screwdriver (for less common bits and sizes)
  - Top pouch
    - Silicone grease
    - Tire inflator nozzle for an air compressor hose
    - Extra X-Acto blades
    - Dental floss
    - Razor blades
    - Sharpening stone
- Third leaf
