**_Did a rocket really fly if you don't have video of it?_**

Ever since the [Estes Cineroc][1] sent 8mm film cameras aloft in the 1970s onboard video has been a part of rocketry.
Digital video has had some catching up to do but nowadays, with advancements in tiny digital cameras being driven by smartphones, we have lots of options.

## Action Cameras

[GoPro][2] is the 800-pound gorilla of action cameras having virtually invented the product category in the early 2000s.
Their current flagship camera is the [Hero 8 Black][3] which is a small marvel but isn't particularly well-suited for rocketry.
Although small in the hand, it is large enough to cause aerodynamic problems for anything other than high-power rockets.
They briefly experimented with a smaller form factor in the form of the Hero Session, the last of which was the [Hero 5 Session][4], but they are only available on the second-hand market.

Another popular choice for rocketry is the [Mobius Mini action camera][5].
I've seen rockets where these were mounted downward-facing on the outside of the airframe and others where they were outward facing from inside the airframe.
They're nice because they offer a small, enclosed package with mounting hardware and have an internal battery[^1].

## Drone Cameras

Aside from action cameras, products designed for drones[^2] are a good source of video cameras for rocketry.
These cameras are designed to minimize size and weight--exactly what you want for rockets.
Most of them have the camera modules on a tether which allows greater mounting flexibility.
However, there is a higher learning curve because these are enthusiast/DIY products instead of consumer products..
The [RunCam Split 3 Nano][6], for example, has an exposed 29mm square control board that needs a 5V regulated power supply.
Thankfully, [Sparkfun][7] has your back with easy-to-use LiPo [boosters][8] and [chargers][9].
You also need to select an appropriate capacity battery.
The Split 3 Nano is rated at 650mA @5V.
So, for a 30 minute recording we'll need to do a little calculation:

Using discrete components is more complicated than cameras with a built-in battery & charger, but the overall video package

## Spy Cameras

[^1]: Charged via _mini_ USB. Boo. USB-C plz or, if you insist on be a barbarian, at least use _micro_ USB.
[^2]: Drone cameras are often built to both transmit _and_ record video. For most rocket flights, video telemetry is a bonus--it's the recording you really want.
