# Craw, Walk, Run

In [Episode #93 of The Rocketry Show][1] they interviewed Matt Steele of [North Coast Rocketry][2]. The conversation touched on a lot of interesting things but two moments stood out to me:

1. When asked how to get started in multi-stage rocketry Matt used the phrase "craw, walk, run" and described how to break a complicated system into simple, sequential steps.
2. Matt favors building multiple copies of the same model back to back instead of in parallel.

These set my mind racing. Improving takes practice.
