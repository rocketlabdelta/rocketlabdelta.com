To fly rockets using a [launch rail][1] you have to decide what kind of rail guide (or "button" if you must) to use and how to attach it.

## Varieties

There are _lots_ of options for 1010/standard size rail guides:

</article>

## Selection

You can spend between 46Â¢ and $100 to add a rail guide to your rocket.
Given the field, which one would you choose?

My favorites are:

1. [SC Precision Airfoil Rail Guide][2] (when I'm feeling fancy--it's $5 more per pair than my second choice). According to [analysis presented by Tim Van Milligan at NARCON 2017][3] (and [referenced on the Apogee Components product page][4]), an airfoil rail guide with a rounded top edge has a coefficient of drag of .24 which is vastly better than the .57 of a conventional button-style rail guide. The drag coefficient is a _multiplier_ in the [drag equation][5] so lower is a lot better--especially at higher speeds (there's a velocity squared in there).
2. [Low-drag airframe mount rail guide from Aero Pack][6] are nicely machined Delrin mounted using a countersunk machine screw into a [provided weld nut][7]. These are the nicest button-style guides I've found.

The [new-style moulded Delrin rail buttons from Rail-Buttons.com][8] are _almost_ as nice as the ones from Aero Pack but I don't like the surface finish as much and they don't come with [an anchor][9] of any kind--just a machine screw.
They're cheaper than the Aero Pack guides and perfectly decent quality so they are a good choice for most people.

I've also had good luck using [ACME Conformal Rail guides][10] on minimum-diameter rockets.

On the [Rocketry Forum][11], [Mike Mulligan][12] suggests [cutting the ACME conformal rail guides in half][13]. That sounds like a good idea to me!

## Placement

While most rockets only have one launch lug, all rockets use _two_ rail guides[^1].
The [original recommendation from Blacksky][14] was to mount one at the base of the rocket and the other 1&ndash;2 caliber below the center of gravity.
This method is [casually endorsed by John Coker][15], and it's what I've always done (because I followed the instructions that came with my first rail guides).
There are other opinions too:

> You should place the two buttons so that they are on either side of the Center-of-Gravity (CG) of the rocket.
> Further apart is better if you have room.  
> <cite>Tim Van Milligan <a href="https://www.apogeerockets.com/education/downloads/Newsletter489.pdf">Peak of Flight #489</a>, p. 2</cite>

> Install one rail button 1" from the aft end of the rocket, and another 4" from the front of the airframe.  
> <cite>Mike Westerfield, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/make-high-power-rockets/9781680454796/">Make: High Power Rockets</a> Figure 3-52, p. 57</cite>

All told, it doesn't seem to matter a whole lot where they are placed as long as you have two of them anchored to the airframe in a straight line.

## Anchoring

It's important to firmly attach rail guides to the airframe of your rocket but you can do it in a lot of different ways:

- Screw it into the airframe (backed with epoxy clay) see [Peak of Flight #489][16]
- Screw it into an internal structure like a centering ring e.g. [blukhead mount (RG10B) rail guides from Aero Pack][17]
- Use a Weld nut e.g. [low drag rail guides (RG10A) from Aero Pack][17], other styles of weld nut can be [sourced from McMaster-Carr][18]
- Use a DIY weld nut e.g. a piece of aluminum tapped for a machine screw, [Make: High Power Rockets][19] p. 56
- Glue a nut to the inside of the airframe with or without a plastic nut holder e.g. the [Nut Holder Kit for 1010 Rail Buttons][20] by [SMT Designs][21]
- Mount a T-nut on a small piece of plywood e.g. [Certify Level 1 by John Coker][22]

There isn't a clear winner here--the best method will depend on the size, weight, and configuration of the rocket.
I like to be able to remove and replace the rail guide if needed so I favor options like the internal T-nut, weld nut, or nut holder--something that adds metal threads to the airframe.

[^1]: I have seen 3 rail guides used on _very_ long, slender rockets and, occasionally, on two-stage rockets but those are exceptional cases. You might be able to get away with one, long rail guide--like the PML linear rail lug--on a small, squat rocket but I don't think it's worth it. Fly-away rail guides are a better choice if you are trying to minimize parasitic drag.
