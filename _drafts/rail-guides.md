If to fly using a [launch rail][1] you have to decide what kind of rail guide (or "button" if you must) to use and how to attach it to your rocket.

## Varieties

There are _lots_ of options for 1010/standard size rail guides:

## Selection

You can spend between Â¢46 and $100 to add a rail guide to your rocket.
Given the field, which one would you choose?

My favorites are:

1. [SC Precision Airfoil Rail Guide][2] (when I'm feeling fancy--it's $5 more per pair than my second choice). According to [analysis presented by Tim Van Milligan at NARCON 2017][3] (and [referenced on the Apogee Components product page][4]), an airfoil rail guide with a rounded top edge has a coefficient of drag of .24 which is vastly better than the .57 of a conventional button-style rail guide. The drag coefficient is a _multiplier_ in the [drag equation][5] so lower is a lot better--especially at higher speeds (there's a velocity squared in there).
2. [Low-drag airframe mount rail guide from Aero Pack][6] are nicely machined Delrin mounted using a countersunk machine screw into a [provided weld nut][7]. These are the nicest button-style guides I've found.

The [new-style moulded Delrin rail buttons from Rail-Buttons.com][8] are _almost_ as nice as the ones from Aero Pack but I don't like the surface finish as much and they don't come with [an anchor][9] of any kind.
They're cheaper that the Aero Pack guides and perfectly decent quality so they would be a good choice for most people.

I've also had good luck with the [ACME Conformal Rail guides][10] for minimum-diameter rockets.

On the [Rocketry Forum][11], [Mike Mulligan][12] suggests [cutting the ACME conformal rail guides in half][13] and that sounds like a good idea to me!

## Placement


## Anchoring

- Direct to airframe (backed with epoxy clay)
- Weld nut
- DIY weld nut
- Plastic nut bracket
- T-Nut on plywood
- Into internal comment e.g. shock cord anchor, centering ring
