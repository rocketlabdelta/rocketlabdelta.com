A rocket must be traveling fast enough so that the air rushing past its fins generates enough lift to achieve stable flight.
So, to ensure a safe, stable trajectory the rocket must be guided upwards until it's going fast enough.
This is usually done with a launch _rod_ or a launch _rail_.

## History

Model rockets are typically flown with the pads included with [the nearly-ubiquitous Estes launch sets][1].
They are small, plastic tripods with a 1/8" diameter rod sticking straight up.
High-power rockets started out as scaled up model rockets.
That meant the rod size grew as the rockets got bigger and heavier--3/16", 1/4", 1/2", 3/4" and so on.

The problem with this is that large rockets _also_ need a _longer_ distance to achieve a safe speed.
An 8-foot 1/2" rod is flexible enough so that when a large rocket is loaded it can bend and sway in the wind.
This flexibility can also cause "rod whip" where the rod can spring back and hit the rocket--or even fling if off course--as it departs the rod.

Enter launch rails.
Blacksky (the now-defunct consumer rocketry company founded by [Scott Bartel][2] almost[^1] single-handedly introduced launch rails to hobby rocketry.
[In 1999 they offered free "standard" rails to 100 rocket clubs][3] and, since then, rails become a fixture of high power launches.
The standard rails were 3-foot lengths of extruded aluminum channel that were joined by a stainless steel bracket on the back[^2].
The also offered a larger "ProRail" system that came in 6-foot lengths and were significantly stronger while still using the same rail guides.
Either by coincidence--or maybe even by design--the Blacksky launch rails and guides were _also_ compatible with the 1", or 1010, aluminum profiles made by [8020][5].
These are readily available from industrial suppliers or directly from the manufacturer in a wide variety of lengths and confutation's.

## Design

> Rail _buttons_ or rail _guides_?
> I call them all rail guides because that's what Blacksky called them when they were first introduced.

The original Rail guides were machined from 3/8" Delrin bar stock with a profile that looked like a squat capital "I" and were mounted to the airframe with 8/32 Phillips pan head screw.
That kind of rail guide is still in use today and is commonly referred to as a rail button (they look a little like a button because they're round).
Rail guides don't have to be round though, nor do they have to be the same size.

There are 4 sizes of commercially available rail guides:

| Size          | Rail                                       |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Micro         | [MakerBeam][6] (10mm)/[OpenBeam][7] (15mm) |
| Mini          | [2020][8] (20mm)                           |
| Standard/1010 | [1010][9] (1"), Blacksky rails             |
| 1515          | [1515][10] (1.5")                          |

Over the years there has been a lot of innovation in the size, shape, and mounting method for rail guides.

[^1]: I had heard of people using sailboat masts as improvised launch rails. They mounted screws most of the way into the airframe and then slid the screw head down the channel of the mast.
[^2]: My dad and I were early adopters of launch rails and used them with rockets down to 38mm in diameter. My dad also used them extensively with his [TARC teams][4].
