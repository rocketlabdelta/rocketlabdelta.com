Based on a [pre-launch checklist][1] by [RandyT0001][2] over on [The Rocketry Forum][3].

## At the Prep Table

### Pre-Flight Inspection

- [ ] All adhesive and paint is dry/cured
- [ ] Motor mount is secure with no loose parts
- [ ] Shock cord/recovery harness has no dry rot, frayed/burnt fibers, or other damage
- [ ] All recovery harness attachment points are intact, secure, and can withstand a sharp tug
- [ ] Jaws of quick-links are secureltswivels They should be securely attached.
- [ ] Tug on both ends of the shock cord or recovery harness. It should be firmly attached.
- [ ] Select a recovery device that is appropriate for rocket's size and weight.
- [ ] Examine recovery device. Shroud lines should be of equal length, firmly attached and not tangled.
- [ ] Parachute or streamer should be strong with no rips or tears.
- [ ] Parachute or streamer must be firmly attached to recovery harness, nose cone and/or body tube.
- [ ] For glider or helicopter recovery check rubber bands and test mechanism or hinges.
- [ ] Nose cone should fit snug, not too loose or too tight.
- [ ] Make sure fins are aligned properly.
- [ ] Check fins and glider wings or helicopter blades. Wood should not have splits or cracks.
- [ ] Try to wiggle fins to make sure fillets do not have any cracks and fins are securely attached.
- [ ] Make sure launch lugs are properly aligned and securely attached to rocket.
- [ ] Make sure body tube is not kinked or warped.
- [ ] Make sure electronics are wired properly with drogue terminals and main terminals connected to proper device.
- [ ] Make sure electronics has good batteries and that appropriate ejection charge(s) are used based on cavity size.
- [ ] Make sure flameproof wadding is installed (Make sure baffles are clear of obstruction).

### Flight Preparation

- [ ] Recovery system should be folded loosely.
- [ ] Install recovery system into rocket. It should slide out easily.
- [ ] Make sure shear pins, if used, are installed and properly sized for rocket size and charge size.
- [ ] Make sure a properly sized motor for the rocket has been selected.
- [ ] Assemble reloadable motor per reload instructions.
- [ ] Make sure delay grain is appropriate for rocket. Make sure ejection charge is loaded in reload casing, if used.
- [ ] Install and secure motor in rocket. Tape igniter to side of rocket.
- [ ] Know your rocket's center of pressure (CP) location. Verify that your rocket has at least one caliber of stability before proceeding to Range Safety Officer's (RSO) location.
- [ ] Present rocket to the Range Safety Officer (RSO) for flight approval. Indicate your rocket's center of pressure (CP) location to the RSO.


## At the Pad

### Range Bag Packing List
- [ ] Baby wipes
- [ ] Fine steel wool
- [ ] #1 Phillips screw driver
- [ ] Flush cutters
- [ ] Adjustable wrench
- [ ] Small level
- [ ] Flashlight
- [ ] OPTIONAL: Allen wrenches
- [ ] OPTIONAL: Multimeter
- [ ] OPTIONAL: Wooden shims or other disposable standoffs

### Load Rocket

- [ ] Tilt down rail (or tip over pad if necessary)
- [ ] Adjust rail standoff to desired height (if present)
- [ ] Clean rail channel with baby wipes
- [ ] Load rocket onto rail
- [ ] Return rocket to vertical
- [ ] Ensure pad is appropriately anchored
- [ ] Verify 90° orientation of rail with level and adjust as necessary
- [ ] OPTIONAL: Use a disposable standoff to ensure the rocket is not resting on the blast deflector

### Prepare Avionics

- [ ] Arm each device and verify it's operation before arming the next
- [ ] Verify ejection charge continuity

### Prepare Starter

- [ ] Disable launch system
- [ ] Verify that no current is present in the igniter clips by brushing them together or using a multimeter
- [ ] Clean igniter clips with steel wool
- [ ] Install igniter and make sure it is touches propellant
- [ ] Ensure the igniter is securely held to the nozzle _without_ causing an airtight seal in the combustion chamber
- [ ] Clip in igniter leads and wrap additional copper around the clips to ensure good electrical contact


## Launch

- [ ] Present flight card to Launch Control Officer (LCO)
- [ ] Enable launch system and check igniter continuity
- [ ] Verify that the launch range and skies above are clear
- [ ] Give an audible 5-second count down
- [ ] Press launch button and watch it fly
