Most hobby rockets have fins made out of flat material--balsa, basswood, birch plywood, G10, carbon plate, etc.--with the ends either rounded or beveled.
I would like to shape the fins of this rockets with a real airfoil profile (or something as close as I can approximate).
These "tiny wings" will be able to generate more aerodynamic lift than their flat-finned counterparts when the rocket needs to make adjustments mid flight, like encountering wind shear or leaving the launch rail

## Design Criteria

- Design for subsonic flights
- Fly to an easily-recoverable altitude--say under 3000 feet--on a small H motor for a HPR Level 1 certification flight
- Be able to fly well on small, HAZMAT-free reloads from Loki Research
- Be able to fly well on long-burn I motors like the [AeroTech I59][2]
- Have a payload bay that can accommodate a variety of video payloads
- Serve as a test-bed for trying new (to me) adhesives and composite materials
- Be as light as I can make it while being strong enough and durable enough for many flights
- Be large enough in diameter that I can test a variety of recovery equipment

My preliminary design for the aerostructure is:
- Use a BT-80 equivalent airframe (LOC 2.56")
- Have a 38mm motor mount
- Favor light materials: thin styrene, cardboard, skeletonized plywood
- Reinforce with lightweight fiberglass lamination and expandable urethane foam
