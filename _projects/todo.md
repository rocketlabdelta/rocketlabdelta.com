# Projects list

## LOC 1
- Fin stock tapering jig for balsa cladding
- Epoxy clay for positioning and contouring nose cone

## Core Construction Challenges

- Fins
  - Alignment
    - Spacing, marking, and positioning
    - Ensuring perpendicular bond
  - Reinforcement
    - Fillet prep, shaping, and finishing
    - Composite prep, lamination, curing, and finishing
  - Airfoils
    - Edge beveling
    - Shaping the lift-generating surface
    - Composite prep, lamination, curing, and finishing
- Airframe
  - Slotting
    - Spacing, marking, and positioning
    - Router
    - Table saw
    - Laser cutter
    - Hand tools
  - Reinforcement
    - Composite prep, lamination, curing, and finishing
    - Treating cut ends
  - Fasteners
    - Alignment, spacing & positioning
  - Venting
- Nose Cone
  - Improving nose/body joint
  - Fasteners
    - Alignment, spacing & positioning

- RECOMMENDED: Fin alignment jig
  - Which size to buy? _The large jig would work for L1, L2 & L3 projects; the mid-sized jig would work for 29-98mm motor mount tubes_.
    - [Small][1] (0.51" to 3.09"; $125) this is the better option. I will mainly be building smaller rockets and prefer to align fins directly to the motor mount
    - * [Mid-sized][2] (1.06" to 4.24"; $176) this is the better option. I will mainly be building smaller rockets and prefer to align fins directly to the motor mount
    - [Large][3] (1.75" to 6.125"; $209)
- RECOMMENDED: Fin beveling jig (this is less important when laminating fins)
  - [John Coker's fin beveling jig and inspired projects][4]
  - [Speedmotion Rockets fin sanding jig][5]
  - [Speedmotion Rockets fin beveling jig][6]
- RECOMMENDED: Tube slotting jig (or get someone else to do it)
  - [John Coker's tube slotting jig and inspired projects][7]
- OPTIONAL: Fin reinforcement jig (this is only required if you want to ensure that the composite has wet-through _and_ you want to remove as much epoxy from the matrix as possible.)
  - [John Coker's tip-to-tip fin layup jig][8]
