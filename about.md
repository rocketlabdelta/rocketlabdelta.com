Rocket Lab Delta is the work of [Dan Horst][1] [TRA][2] #8886, [NAR][3] #70699.

## Backstory

I am a BAR, having reconnected with rocketry in 2020 after leaving the hobby in the early 2000s.
My first rocket was an Estes Bull Pup I saw at Walmart as a seventh-grader in 1995.
In eighth grade, I was introduced to High Power Rocketry by Kurt Cripe, a friend's dad.

My first HPR launch was in Three Oaks, MI in the fall of 1996.
My dad, Ken Horst, and I dove deep into rocketry after that.
The basement workshop of my parent's home was christened "The Rocket Lab" and it was outfitted with progressively larger power tools so that we could fabricate more sophisticated rockets.
Over the next 8 years, I spent countless hours in the shop learning and practicing how to build rockets that could withstand the forces of high-power flight and recovery.
I fabricated dozens upon dozens of components -- fins, bulkheads, centering rings, pistons, "sleds" for electronics, etc. -- from balsa, aircraft-grade plywood, and G-10 fiberglass sheeting accented with aluminum, cork, cherry wood, all-thread, t-nuts, polystyrene, and stainless steel fittings.
I used a lathe to turn many a nose cone from poplar and, occasionally, basswood.
I learned how to use different viscosities and formulations of cyanoacrylate (super glue) and epoxy to make bonds and reinforce surfaces.
I used fiberglass, Kevlar, and carbon fiber to strengthen airframes, laminate fins, and reinforce joints.
I got quite good at filling wood grain, smoothing surfaces, and using spray paint.

In the fall of 1998, I discovered the rocketry competition at the Elkhart County 4-H fair, one of the largest county fairs in the nation, and said to myself "I could do better than that" after looking at my competition.
For the next four years, every year I was eligible to compete, my rocket was selected for the state fair.
I still have two of my entries: a scratch-built 3" Ares (4×29mm), and a scratch-built 2-stage BT-60 WAC Corporal (3×18mm to 24mm).
Neither one of them has flown but they were designed and built so that they could.

My dad and I started using avionics early on in our HPR models.
We tried many different altimeters but used the BlackSky AltAcc the most.
My personal favorite was the AED R-DAS which was the same form factor as the AltAcc but gathered more data and had a serial bus to attach additional sensors.
(Both Blacksky and AED are no longer in business.)
I scratch-built at least a half dozen dual-deployment rockets trying out different arrangements for recovery bays, power management, pyrotechnic charges, arming switches, and recovery harnesses.

By 2001 we were ready to do something more sophisticated with electronic payloads.
My dad started the Goshen Radios Aloft Group (G-RAG) where we enlisted several HAM radio enthusiasts to help develop a real-time GPS telemetry package that used packet radio over the 2-meter HAM radio band.
Our final project was featured in the January/February issue of Sport Rocketry in 2002.
The 3-inch launch vehicle I built for that project flew different payload configurations for several years starting in 2001.
The rocket was retired after losing a fin to a hard landing in the Nevada desert at LDRS 26 (2007).

My dad, now retired, was a physics teacher at Goshen High School and coached at least one team for the Team America Rocketry Challenge from its inaugural year in 2002 until he retired in 2012.
Several of the teams made it to nationals under his leadership.
I missed the age cutoff to participate as a team member (if only they had started it one year earlier!) so I was an assistant coach for several years instead.
I helped with web content, built a reference launch vehicle, and helped out where I could.
One of his teams was selected to participate in the NASA Student Launch Initiative after placing well and I played a minor assisting role in that project too.

My last rocketry endeavors before the long break were:

* Overseer: A 4-inch diameter dual-altimeter, dual-deploy rocket I used to certify TRA Level 2 at LRDS 21 in Wayside, TX (2002)
* Optimistic: A 54mm minimum-diameter Dynacom filament-wound fiberglass rocket I flew to 8300 feet at LDRS 23 in Geneseo, NY (2004)

# Why I Like Rocketry

Rocketry presents a wide variety of engineering challenges that are accessible to people who aren't trained as engineers.
For example, even the most technical sections of the [Handbook of Model Rocketry][4] employ high-school-level physics.
(This is a good thing! I had a blast in high school physics!)
These challenges come in two flavors: building & flying.

## Building

Building a rocket can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be.
For beginners, Estes has [ready-to-fly rocket kits][5] and if you want something rated for high-power grab [an ACME fin can from Giant Leap Rocketry][6] and you're almost done.
When you're ready for more [SBR][7], for example, has well-designed HPR kits with very detailed instructions--you just have to follow them and put it together.

I don't make very many rocket kits because I enjoy the process of making trade-offs when I design rockets from scratch.
There are lots of things to consider, but most of them fall into one of five categories:

 1. Motor selection and ignition: "right-sizing" for the rocket, the launch field, the waiver, and how far you want to walk 
 2. Aerodynamics: rocket length & diameter, fin size & shape
 3. Material selection and construction: airframes, nose cones, structural components, airfoil design, adhesives, etc.
 4. Recovery system: harness, fasteners, parachute(s), heat shielding and/or baffling (nylon parachutes melt under the direct heat of an ejection charge), flight electronics, parachute releases, recovery bags, etc.
 5. Finishing: filling, painting, decals, etc.

The most common thing to fail in an HPR flight is the recovery system.
(This isn't that surprising because it is the most complicated part of a rocket flight.)
Common failures include:

- The nose cone comes off too easily and the ejection charge "blows past" the parachute leaving it still in the rocket body.
- The parachute doesn't fully deploy or gets tangled.
- The electronics fail for some reason and the rocket hits the ground at ballistic speed.

Go to a rocket launch and watch for what goes wrong.
Think about what you could to do mitigate the risk of that happening to you.

I have also seen rockets fall to pieces under thrust.
It's better to over-build and have it weigh a little more than for a rocket to break apart and be hazardous to spectators.

## Flying

You need a big field and an FAA waiver to fly high-power rockets.
Because of this, virtually all rockets from mid-power on up are flown at launches organized by a regional rocket club.
Do some research and find where clubs are in your area.
The field size requirements mean that launches are, as a rule, in a rural area so you'll probably have to drive for a while to get there.
Both NAR and Tripoli have annual launches, NARAM and LDRS respectively.
They are defiantly worth the trip if you can make it.

I like prepping my rockets in the field.
This means:

- Assembling re-loadable motors like [AeroTech][8] RMS or [Cesaroni][9] ProX
- Packing the recovery system
- Loading ejection charges
- Testing flight electronics
- Checking for the right amount of friction between rocket components that separate during flight

Make a checklist!
There are lots of things to remember!

At launches, there are lots of people to meet and talk to where you already have something in common (besides the weather).
It's fun to walk around and see what other people are doing and their take on the hobby. 
Maybe I'll see you there someday!
