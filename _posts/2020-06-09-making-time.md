I struggle with [time optimism][1][^1] (I think it will take me _way_ less time to do something than it actually does).
This makes it easy to become demoralized because I consistently don't meet my own (unreasonable) expectations for my productivity.

To help keep me accountable, I'm using [Beeminder][3] to track the [time I spend on rockets][4] (work on the website counts too).
I set a goal of doing at least 4 hours a week.
This encourages me to carve out small chucks of time from my day to spend time doing the things I love instead of assuming I'll get to it eventually once my battle with entropy--otherwise known as being an adult homeowner--is won.

I'll reassess in a few weeks but it's been working well for me so far.

*UPDATE 2020-08-18* I have stopped using Beeminder for tracking my recreation time.
I ended up stressing out about it thus diminishing its utility.
For the foreseeable future, I will be juggling lots of things around the house that are more important than fulfilling a quota of hours for recreation.

I know there's a lot of unrest in the world right now.
I am privileged to be able to set aside time for self-care.
Even in the face of widespread fear and grave injustice it is still important to take care of yourself--just don't stick your head in the sand.

[^1]: This means I routinely fall victim to the [planning fallacy][4].
