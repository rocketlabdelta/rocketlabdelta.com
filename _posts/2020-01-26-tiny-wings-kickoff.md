The [Tiny Wings][1] project will determine the fin design for my second[^1] HPR Level 1 certification launch vehicle.
I may post occasional updates in the blog, but the bulk of the work will happen on [the project page in Notion][1].
When the project is complete, it'll be published on [its project page here][2].

*[HPR]: High Power Rocketry

[^1]: Come to find out, certifications expire if you don't maintain active membership in a rocketry organization.
