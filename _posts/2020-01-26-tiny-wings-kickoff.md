The [Tiny Wings][1] project will determine the fin design for my HPR Level 1 certification launch vehicle.
(Come to find out, certifications expire if you don't maintain active membership in a rocketry organization.)
I'll post occasional updates in the blog, but the bulk of the work will happen on [the project page][1].
