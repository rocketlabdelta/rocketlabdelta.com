As I awaken from my [fifteen-year rocketry slumber][1] and [take a look around][2] the market for altimeters is very different[^1].
All the vendors I was familiar with--BlackSky, AED, Transolve, Olsen, G-Wiz, Adept--are gone.
Cheap, powerful microcontroller, and even whole computers, can be easily fit into rockets thanks to [Arduino][3], [Raspberry Pi][4], [Beagleboard][5], and others.
Why not grab an [accelerometer break-out board from Sparkfun][6] ([like this one][7], rated to 200g!) wire it up, and gather all the data your heart desires?

I might take this approach for electronic payloads in the future but I _do not_ want to trust safe recovery of my rocket to my embedded programming skills.
It would be one thing if all I wanted to know is how high the flight was[^2], but, as it is, I expect a lot more from my avionics.

## Criteria
Here's what I want:

- **Small**: the altimeters of yore required a 38mm mounting tube, we can do better than that.
- **Multi-sensor**: lots of altimeters only have barometric sensors. This works great while measuring the _descent_ of a rocket, but it is not particularly well-suited for measuring and recording the _ascent_ of a rocket[^3]. During powered flight, I want a sensitive accelerometer gathering data at a high polling rate.
- **Recording**: I don't just want to what the maximum altitude was, I want to be able to inspect the entire flight profile, export the data, and be able to analyze it later.
- **Pyro-channels**: I want to be able to _at least_ fire drogue and main recovery charges for dual deployment flights. Safe[^4] staging and air-start controls are a bonus.
- **Li-Po friendly**: Lithium polymer batteries are light, can deliver a high current, and are rechargeable. It is better battery technology than alkaline 9 volts or the NiCads of old.
- **Phone-first**: I don't want to have to lug a laptop around with me to configure or retrieve data from my altimeter. I want to use the computer I have in my pocket--my (Android) phone.

## Options
The players (in alphabetical order):

- **Adrel Electronics**: the [ATL-BMP][8] (~$70) is a tiny competition altimeter. It is really just a 1g data logger; the maximum altitude and flight profile is calculated after the fact using Windows desktop software.
- [**Altus Metrum**][9]: the [EasyMega][9a] (~[$350][9b]) is a fairly-compact (fits in a 38mm coupler), multi-sensor recording altimeter designed to work with LiPo batteries. It is also available with a 2m HAM-band radio downlink as the [TeleMega][9c] (~[$460][9d]). The [EasyMini][9e] (~[$93][9f]) is a dual-deploy recording altimeter that is _much_ smaller (fits in a 24mm coupler) and cheaper but is barometric-only. All three of these altimters, even the smaller one, have built-in USB ports for downloading flight data to a computer.
- [**ENTACore Electronics**][10]: [AIM USB][10a] (~$115) fairly-compact, LiPo-friendly, recording altimter with built-in USB connectivity--barometric only, [AIM XTRA][10b] _also_ has GPS telemetry and is thus expensive (~$420).
- [**Eggtimer Rocketry**][11]: the [Proton][11a] (~$70) has all the features I want but the package size is too large and you have to solder it together yourself--that's why it's so inexpensive. My soldering and electronics debugging skills are not up to that level.
- [**Featherweight Altimiters**][12]: the [Raven 4][12a] (~$160) has a spec sheet that reads like a dream and you can get a [24mm telemetry bay][12b] for it! Still expects a USB/PC interface though.
- [**FlightSketch**][13]: only offers the [Mini][13a] (~$40) right now and that isn't what I'm looking for. However, the [design philosophy][13b] is spot-on so I have hight hopes for the rest of their product line. The [Sport][13c] looks just about perfect and the [SST][13d] (GPS tracker) also looks promising.
- [**Jolly Logic**][14]: the [Altimeter 3][14a] (~$100) is a recoding altimeter that works with your phone but there are no pyro channels. The [Chute Relase][14b] is super cool though. It makes other modes of dual-deployment possible in such a way that I may need to rethink my criteria for avionics.
- [**Marsa Systems**][15]: the Marsa33LHD (~$200) is a _very_ sophisticated flight computer--you can even get it ruggedized for $20 more--but it's really big (54mm diameter mounting tube) and is built for a USB/PC interface. [MarsaNet][15a] is a wireless (!) expansion module system (~$70/RX--up to 2, ~$50/TX) that adds more pyro channels--this is kind of crazy but a cool idea.
- [**Missile Works**][16]: the [RRC3][16a] (~[$70][16b]-[$80][16c]) and [RRC2+][16d] (~[$45][16e]) are barometric-only with an "old-school" vibe. The RRC3 is a recording altimeter and it can also be used with their [telemetry packages][16f] to transmit live data to a ground station.
- [**PerfectFlite**][17]: the [StratoLoggerCF][17a] (~$70) is a small, barometric-only, dual-deploy, recording altimeter. It requires a [separate USB adapter][17b] (~$30) to download the data to a PC.

## TLDR

Great.
No products on the market--at least that I could find--meet all of my criteria.
Given the field, my recommendations are:

1. [Featherweight Altimeters Raven 4][12a] ~$160
2. [Altus Metrum EasyMini][9e] ([available from Apogee Components][9f]) ~$93
3. [PerfectFlite StratoLoggerCF][17a] with [USB adapter][17b] ~$100 total

**HONORABLE MENTION**: [Marasa Systems Marsa33LHD][15] (~$200) is super cool--it's got that _serious_ flight computer look and the specs to back it up. Marasa Systems feels like the spiritual successor to AED. Because of it's size it is really only suitable for HPR.

I'm holding out hope that the [FlightSketch Sport][13c] will be released soon because it is the only product I've found that ticks all the boxes.

*[TLDR]: Too Long; Didn't Read
*[HPR]: High-Power Rocketry

[^1]: I know because I am in the market for an altimeter. Technically, I have one already: an AED R-DAS mini that has been sitting in a cardboard box for the better part of a decade. Have the capacitors degraded? Does it need to be calibrated? I don't know. Also, AED went out of business last year and the only copy I have of the control software is sitting on a 3.5" floppy. It probably still works fine but I'll have to use a USB-serial adapter and hope Windows Compatibility mode can sort everything out (assuming I can _find_ a floppy drive somewhere).
[^2]: If you join NAR they send you a copy of the "NAR Member Guidebook" that has all kinds of helpful information. "How High Does It Go? Electronic Altimeters" by Bernard Cawley has a detailed breakdown of 8 model-rocket-sized maximum altitude altimeters. They are all competition certified.
[^3]: Reasons for this include: low polling rates, low resolution, and worse yet if the rocket breaks the sound barrier there will be a pressure wave that makes the readings unstable during the mach transition. (This used to cause all kinds of problems with old altimeters--like parachutes deploying when the rocket is traveling at maximum speed because a sharp decrease in pressure registered as an apogee event. Then "mach" timers were included to prevent deployment charges from firing for a set number of seconds. Now, I hear this is all avoided with better software but I'm still wary.)
[^4]: By "safe" I mean: "Don't start the second stage if it is pointing at the ground." This is why you need sophisticated embedded programming at the heart of your avionics.
