As I awaken from my [fifteen-year rocketry slumber][1] and [take a look around][2] the market for altimeters is very different[^1].
All the vendors I was familiar with--BlackSky, AED, Transolve, Olsen, G-Wiz, Adept--are gone.
Cheap, powerful microcontroller, and even whole computers, can be easily fit into rockets thanks to [Arduino][3], [Raspberry Pi][4], [Beagleboard][5], and others.
Why not grab an [accelerometer break-out board from Sparkfun][6] ([like this one][7], rated to 200g!) wire it up, and gather all the data your heart desires?

I may take this approach for electronic payloads in the future but I _do not_ want to trust safe recovery of my rocket to my embedded programming skills.
It would be one thing if all I wanted to know is how high the flight was[^2], but, as it is, I expect a lot more from my avionics.

Here's what I want:

- **Small**: the altimeters of yore required a 38mm tube, we can do better than that.
- **Multi-sensor**: lots of altimeters only have barometric sensors. This works great while measureing the _descent_ of a rocket, but it is not well-suited for measuring and recording the _ascent_ of a rocket[^3]. I want a sensitive accelerometer gathering data at a high polling rate.
- **Recording**: I don't just want to what the maximum altitude was, I want to be able to inspect the entire flight profile, export the data, and be able to analyze it later.
- **Pyro-channels**: I want to be able to _at least_ fire drogue and main recovery charges for dual deployment flights. Safe[^4] staging and air-start controls are a bonus.
- **Li-Po friendly**: Lithium polymer batteries are light, can deliver a high current, and are rechargeable. It is better battery technology than alkaline 9 volts or the NiCads of old.
- **Phone-first**: I don't want to have to lug a laptop around with me to configure or retrieve data from my altimeter. I want to use the computer I have in my pocket--my (Android) phone.

The players (in alphabetical order):

- **Adrel Electronics**: the [ATL-BMP][8] (~$70) is a tiny competition altimeter; not what I'm looking for (but so tiny!)
- [**Altus Metrum**][9]: several suitable products
- [**ENTACore Electronics**][10]: [AIM USB][10a] (~$115) doesn't have an accelerometer, [AIM XTRA][10b] _also_ has GPS telemetry and is thus expensive (~$420); both expect USB/PC interfaces
- [**Eggtimer Rocketry**][11]: the [Proton][11a] (~$70) has all the features I want but the package size is too large and you have to solder it together yourself--that's why it's so inexpensive. My soldering and electronics debugging skills are not up to that level.
- [**Featherweight Altimiters**][12]: the [Raven 4][12a] (~$160) has a spec sheet that reads like a dream and you can get a [24mm telemetry bay][12b] for it! Still expects a USB/PC interface though.
- [**FlightSketch**][13]: only offers the [Mini][13a] (~$40) right now and that isn't what I'm looking for. However, the [design philosophy][13b] is spot-on so I have hight hopes for the rest of their product line. The [Sport][13c] looks just about perfect and the [SST][13d] (GPS tracker) also looks promising.
- [**Jolly Logic**][14]: the [Altimeter 3][14a] (~$100) _is_ a recoding altimeter that works with your phone, but there are no pyro channels. The [Chute Relase][14b] is super cool though. That makes other modes of dual-deployment possible in such a way that I may need to rethink my original avionics criteria.
- [**Marsa Systems**][15]: the Marsa33LHD (~$200) is a very sophisticated flight computer, you can even get it ruggidaized for $20 more, but it's really big (54mm diameter mounting tube) and is built for a USB/PC interface. [MarsaNet][15a] is a wireless (!) expansion module system (~$70/RX--up to 2, ~$50/TX) that adds more pyro channels--this is kind of crazy but a cool idea.
- [**Missile Works**][16]: the [RRC 3][16a] and [RRC2+] are barometric-only
- [**PerfectFlite**][17]:

[^1]: I know because I am in the market for an altimeter. Technically, I have one already: an AED R-DAS mini that has been sitting in a cardboard box for the better part of a decade. Have the capacitors degraded? Does it need to be calibrated? I don't know. Also, AED went out of business last year and the only copy I have of the control software is sitting on a 3.5" floppy. It probably still works fine but I'll have to use a USB-serial adapter and hope Windows Compatibility mode can sort everything out (assuming I can _find_ a floppy drive somewhere).
[^2]: If you join NAR they send you a copy of the "NAR Member Guidebook" that has all kinds of helpful information. "How High Does It Go? Electronic Altimeters" by Bernard Cawley has a detailed breakdown of 8 model-rocket-sized maximum altitude altimeters. They are all competition certified.
[^3]: Reasons for this include: low polling rates, low resolution, and worse yet if the rocket breaks the sound barrier there will be a pressure wave that makes the readings unstable during the mach transition. (This used to cause all kinds of problems with old altimeters--like parachutes deploying when the rocket is traveling at maximum speed because a sharp decrease in pressure registered as an apogee event. Then "mach" timers were included to prevent deployment charges from firing for a set number of seconds. Now, I hear this is all avoided with better software but I'm still wary.)
[^4]: By "safe" I mean: "Don't start the second stage if it is pointing at the ground." This is why you need sophisticated embedded programming at the heart of your avionics.
