A rocket must be traveling fast enough so that the air rushing past its fins generates enough lift to achieve stable flight.
So, to ensure a safe, stable trajectory the rocket must be guided upwards until it's going fast enough.
This is usually done with a launch _rod_ or a launch _rail_.

## History

Model rockets are typically flown with the launch pads included with [the nearly-ubiquitous Estes launch sets][1].
They are small, plastic tripods with a 1/8" diameter rod sticking straight up.
High-power rockets started out as scaled up model rockets so the rod size grew as the rockets got bigger and heavier--3/16", 1/4", 1/2", 3/4" and so on.

This presents a problem because larger rockets _also_ need to be guided for a longer distance than model rockets to achieve a safe speed.
An 8-foot 1/2" rod is flexible enough so that when a large rocket is loaded onto the pad the rod can bend and sway in the wind.
This flexibility can cause "rod whip" where the rod can spring back and hit the rocket--or even fling if off course--as it departs the rod.

Blacksky, the now-defunct consumer rocketry company founded by [Scott Bartel][2], almost[^1] single-handedly introduced launch rails to hobby rocketry to solve these problems.
[In 1999 they offered free "standard" rails to 100 rocket clubs][3] and, since then, rails become a fixture of high power launches[^2].
The Blacksky standard rails were 2 2-foot lengths of extruded aluminum channel joined by a stainless steel bracket on the back[^3].
The larger "ProRail" system came in 6-foot lengths and was significantly stronger.
Both Blacksky rails used the same size of rail guides.
Either by coincidence--or maybe even by design--Blacksky rail guides were _also_ compatible with the 1", or 1010, aluminum profiles made by [8020][5].
These are readily available from industrial suppliers or directly from the manufacturer in a wide variety of lengths and confutations.

The original Blacksky rail guides were machined from 3/8" Delrin (acetal/Polyoxymethylene) bar stock with a profile of a squat capital "I".
They were mounted to the airframe with 8/32 Phillips pan head screw.
That style of rail guide is still in use today and is commonly referred to as a "rail button" (they look a little like a button because they're round).
Rail guides don't have to be round though, nor do they have to be the same size.

> Rail _buttons_ or rail _guides_?  
> Rail guides can be any shape or size. Rail buttons are round rail guides. (I don't think this distinction is helpful. I call them all rail guides because that's what Blacksky called them when they were first introduced.)

## Sizes

There are 4 sizes of commercially available rail guides:

| Guide Size    | Rail                                       |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Micro         | [MakerBeam][6] (10mm)/[OpenBeam][7] (15mm) |
| Mini          | [2020][8] (20mm)                           |
| Standard/1010 | [1010][9] (1"), Blacksky rails             |
| 1515          | [1515][10] (1.5")                          |

The smaller two sizes--mini and micro--are available from [Rail-buttons.com][11].
1010/starndard is the most common size so there are a [variety of different styles and materials available from many different rocketry vendors][12].
See [selecting a rail guide][13] for how I decide between them.

[^1]: I have heard of people using sailboat masts as improvised launch rails in the 90s. They sunk screws most of the way into the airframe and then slid the screw head down the channel of the mast.
[^2]: Because they were the de facto standard, you still see "Blacksky compatible" in marketing copy for rails and rail guides on some rocketry vendor websites 20 years later.
[^3]: My dad and I were early adopters of launch rails and used them with rockets down to 38mm in diameter. My dad also used them extensively with his [TARC teams][4].
